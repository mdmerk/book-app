# book-app
Work in progress Ionic book reading app that was initially made for a bootcamp project.

Currently holds two placeholder books and has simple navigation. As I have time, I plan on adding data persistance so users can open the app to the page they left off on, and cleaning up the styling. I would also like to add some interesting page transitions, which I have looked into already.
